## Question (ii)
**The estimated coefficient on annual energy expenditures is -1.40. How should we interpret
this estimate, exactly? Please relate your explanation to the latent utility parameters in
equation (1).**

$\hat\alpha_1\approx-1.40$ is relative to the household-specific utility parameters $\alpha_{2e}$.
Since it's larger than most of the other parameters, assuming the utility model is correct, we
could say that, for example, consumers on average get more disutility from heating under a \$1000 
of increased energy expenditures than the increased utility of their heating when the household gains \$100,000, ceteris paribus.
Since we have normalized $\alpha_{2g}$ to zero, we can only say this for the increase in household income
under electric heating.

I think the assumptions on the utility model (specifically that the energy
expenditure utility coefficient $\alpha_1$ is shared between households seems unreasonable to me).



## Question (iii)
**Calibrate the willingness to pay to avoid an electrification mandate for each household
(replicating the exercise described in section 4.3 of the paper). Focusing on California,
summarize the implied distribution of WTP estimates for these California households. What
generates variation in these WTP estimates in this conditional logit model?**

\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Since }
-\log\mathbb{P}(i\text{ chooses electric})
&=-\log\frac
{\exp\{\alpha_{0e} + \alpha_1x_{ie} + \alpha_{2e}z_i\}}
{\exp\{\alpha_{0e} + \alpha_1x_{ie} + \alpha_{2e}z_i\} + \exp\{\alpha_1x_{ig}\}}\\[1em]
&= \log\left[\exp\{\alpha_{0e} + \alpha_1x_{ie} + \alpha_{2e}z_i\} + \exp\{\alpha_1x_{ig}\}\right]
- \log\exp\{\alpha_{0e} + \alpha_1x_{ie} + \alpha_{2e}z_i\}\\[1em]
\text{then } \widehat{WTP}_i &= -\frac{1}{|\hat\alpha_1|}\log\hat{\mathbb{P}}(i\text{ chooses electric})
\end{aligned}\]

First, we can predict $\hat{\mathbb{P}}(i\text{ chooses electric})$ from our conditional
logit. Then, for each household, we have the probability of choosing electric on the
alternative = electric row and 1 - that on the alternative = natural gas row. For each house,
we then select just the electric row to be $\hat{\mathbb{P}}(i\text{ chooses electric})$.
Then, dividing the predicted values
by $-\frac{1}{|\hat\alpha_1|}$ should give us the WTP estimates for households in our sample.


```
# Predict the probability for each row
predict p
# Capture the marginal utility of heating expenditure
local alpha1 e(b)[1,1]
# Generate the WTP for each row
gen wtp = -log(p)/abs(`alpha1')
# Average WTP for each state for only for electricity rows
tabstat wtp if alternative == "Electricity" [weight = hhwt], by(statecode)
```

## Question (iv)
**Recall that regulated retail energy prices in California are higher than social marginal cost
(SMC) so as to recover fixed/legacy costs. In recent years, Borenstein and Bushnell have
estimated that the social marginal cost of natural gas production is about $9/1000 cu ft.
Borenstein, Fowlie, and Sallee have estimated that the social marginal cost of electricity
consumption is about 10 cents per kWh.**

**Focus on the period 2010-2018 in the data and assume that the SMC is $9/1000 cu ft for
natural gas and $0.10/kWh (nominal) over this entire period. Use Lucasâ€™s model to first
predict heating choices for households in California survey respondents over the period
2010-2018 using observed nominal prices. Report the predicted share of households
choosing electric heat. Then, for these same households, predict how electrification rates
would likely have differed if prices were set at SMC values over this period.**

**Based on your simulation results, are Californiaâ€™s relatively high retail electricity prices
slowing the transition to building electrification? If yes, by approximately how much?**

Predict choice given the calibrated model and the estimated expenditures we're given

```
gen choice_hat1 = (p > 0.5)
gen elec_hat1 = (choice_hat1 == 1 & alternative == "Electricity")
```

How many of the choices are different than actual choices?
```
gen diff = abs(choice - choice_hat1)
sum diff

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
        diff |  1,900,938     .270315    .4441226          0          1
```

This tells us that 27% of the predicted choices are different than the actual
observed choice.

Calcuate the new expenditure based on SMC
```
local gas_smc = 9
local elec_smc = 10
gen expenditure_old = expenditure
replace expenditure = expenditure_old / ngprice * `gas_smc' if alternative == "Natural Gas"
replace expenditure = expenditure_old / elecprice * `elec_smc' if alternative == "Electricity"
```

Predict new choice
```
estimates restore m1
predict p2
gen choice_hat2 = (p2 > 0.5)
gen elec_hat2 = (choice_hat2 == 1 & alternative == "Electricity")
sum elec elec_hat1 elec_hat2 if statecode == "CA"

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
        elec |    156,190    .2893015    .4534396          0          1
   elec_hat1 |    156,190    .1419425    .3489923          0          1
   elec_hat2 |    156,190    .3861131    .4868586          0          1
```

So about 29% of CA households actually chose electric heating in the study period. We predicted
about 14% households would choose electric heating after calibrating our model on the the
whole use (controlling for the 9 regions), which increased to a predicted 39% of
households would choose electric if the prices were reduced to the SMC of gas and
electric. This implies that, under the assumption of constant consumption of heating,
decreasing the prices would increase the shift to electrification by somewhere between
38.6% - 28.9% = `r round((0.3861131 - 0.2893015)*100,1)`% (if we wanted to use the observed share
of electrically heated houses) and 38.6% - 14.2% = `r round((0.3861131 - 0.1419425)*100,1)`%
(if we wanted to use both the predicted choice shares).

## Question 1.1.1

**Describe in words what the $\delta$ parameters represent. Provide a verbal explanation of
how these $\delta$s are estimated using Equations 10, 11, and 12.**

For individual $i$ in location $k$, they receive utility $U_{i,k}$, which is modeled
as the sum of a population-mean utility for that location $\delta_k$ and that
individual's idiosyncratic deviation from the mean $\eta_{i,k}$.
\[
U_{i,k} = \delta_k + \eta_{i,k}
\]
We assume that the mean utility for location $k$ ($\delta_k$) is a function of location
attributes ($X_k$), location unobservables ($\xi_k$), and a vector of parameters ($\beta$)
\[
\delta_k = f(X_k, \xi_k; \beta)
\]

Our vector of mean utilities $\delta$ fit into a vector of equations (11). (11) 
relates each observed racial population share in 2010 $\sigma_j^{2010}$ to a 
weighted sum of the other population shares in 2000 $\sigma_k^{2000}$. Moving costs 
($MC_{j,k}$) are also involved but are ex-ante estimable so we do not need to consider
them -- we just need to search over $\mu$. 


Since (11) is a vector of shares relating to a weighted sum of other shares,
where the weights are adjusted by the $\delta$s and each weight is in the [0,1] interval,
this defines a contraction mapping.
Berry (1994) uses contraction mapping to define and update function (equation 12) 
to iteratively get closer to the best-fit value
of $\delta$s that fit our observed $\sigma_j$ and $MC_{j,k}$ in equation (11).
After convergence of the $\delta$s, we then just need to search over the $\mu$
space to find the $\mu$ that results in shares that best match our observed shares
in 2000 and 2010.

## Question 1.2.2

**What are the only variables remaining in the cleaned data frame? How are these implicated in the
estimation of the vector of deltas?**

\vspace{2em}

\texttt{FIPS, nh00, nh10, mc, sigma\_00, sigma\_10} -- the census tract FIPS code, number of White (Hispanic)
residents in 2000 in the tract, number of White (Hispanic) residents in 2010 in
the tract, the moving cost associated with that tract, the share of all White (Hispanic) 
residents in that tract in 2000, and the share of all White (Hispanic) residents 
in that tract in 2010. 

As it mentions in the paper,
moving costs from tract $j$ to $k$ would be the sum of a weighted 3% of median housing
value in both tracts. So from the formula used, it looks like if I move from $j$ 
to $k$, I would be experiencing a moving cost of \texttt{mc$_j$ + mc$_k$}, and 0
if I don't move tracts.

So the FIPS code gives us our $j,k$ indicies in equation (11) and our $\sigma_k^t$ and $MC_{j,k}$
are in (or easily generated from) the dataframe, so we can continue with estimation
of the $\delta$s!

```

For the original code section for \texttt{\# denom for eqn 11}, this was to fill in
each component of the \texttt{denom} vector (the $k^{th}$ iteration of the outer sum).
The suggested function was going to create the value of the denominator for each
of the $N+1$ iterations of the outer sum, but make sure that MC = 0 for the iteration
where $l=k$ since there are no moving costs if you stay in the same tract.

For the original code section for \texttt{\# Create the bigger summation for equation 11},
this was to create the numerator terms and divide by the correct denominator term, 
again insuring that $MC_{j,k}$ = 0 when $j=k$.

For the original code section for \texttt{\# create the new guess}, we just needed
to fill in the new $\delta_1$ guess from equation (11) -- contraction mapping
iterative convergence to the $\delta$ that best fits the population shares.

I modified these sections to utilize vector summations.

  #add the new delta_guess

# To run the function, use this code:
set.seed(08241987)
delta_df <- deltas(la_data_white, rnorm(nrow(la_data_white),1000,10), mu_guess=.003,
                   kill=1000)
```

## Question 1.3.2

**Take the following steps:**

- **Set kill=1. Notice, in the first run, \texttt{delta\_0} is randomly generated. What do the
predicted population shares like? How different are the new delta guesses 
(\texttt{delta\_1})? Why do some tracts have higher values of \texttt{delta\_1}?**

\vspace{2em}
```{r 1 iteration, results='hide'}
set.seed(08241987)
delta_guess1 = rnorm(nrow(la_data_white),1000,10)
result1 = deltas(df = la_data_white,
                   delta_guess = delta_guess1,
                   mu_guess = .003,
                   counter_max = 1)
```

Most of the predicted population shares for 2010 (\texttt{sigma_10_hat}) look very
small, except three. The three that are not small are about 67%, 21%, and 14%. The
mean absolute difference (MAD) of $\sigma_{2010}$ and $\tilde\sigma_{2010}$ is 
`r round(result1$MADdf$sigma[1], 4)` (for comparison to later iterations).

The new \texttt{delta\_1} guesses are not far from the original \texttt{delta\_0} guesses
(a MAD of `r round(result1$MADdf$delta[1], 4)`), but that is because
we started with a guess centered at 1000 and that seems to be the point where all
the \texttt{delta\_1}'s are ultimately converging to (around 1010). However, it is interesting
note that the \texttt{delta\_1}'s are heading to 1010 rapidly -- even the deltas that started
around 990 jump immediately to within 2 of 1010. Thanks contraction mapping!

Some tracts have higher values of \texttt{delta\_1} because they have relatively
small denominator values (\texttt{denom}). But it's also because they started with
\texttt{delta\_0} guesses above 1010, so they are moving downward toward 1010 instead
of up from underneath.




\vspace{3em}
- **Now run the code with kill=2 and kill=3. How accurate are the predicted population shares
now? How much difference is there between the $\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$?**

\vspace{2em}
```{r 2 and 3 iterations, results='hide'}
result3 <- deltas(df = la_data_white,
                   delta_guess = delta_guess1,
                   mu_guess = .003,
                   counter_max = 3)
```


The new $\tilde\sigma_{2010}$ are much closer to $\sigma_{2010}$. The MAD for 2 
iterations is `r round(result3$MADdf$sigma[2], 4)` and `r round(result3$MADdf$sigma[3], 4)`
for 3 iterations.

The deltas have a MAD of `r round(result3$MADdf$delta[2], 4)` for
2 iterations and `r round(result3$MADdf$delta[3], 4)` for 3 iterations. Much less difference
than the MAD of ~`r round(result3$MADdf$delta[1], 1)` for the first iteration. 



\newpage
- **Now run the function with kill=1000. Hopefully, the equation should converge after about
20 to 25 loops. What exactly is happening when it 'converges' (ie: what does it mean that \texttt{sum(df\$delta\_fail)==0})?**

\vspace{2em}
```{r 1000 iterations, results='hide'}
result1000 <- deltas(df = la_data_white,
                     delta_guess = delta_guess1,
                     mu_guess = .003,
                     counter_max = 1000)
result1000$iterations
```

Convergence happened after `r result1000$iterations` iterations.

\texttt{df\$delta\_fail} is a boolean (T or F) for each tract on whether or
not \texttt{delta\_1} and \texttt{delta\_0} has converged (if $|\delta^1_j - \delta^0_j|<10^{8}$).
In R, boolean data types are evaluated as integers when evaluated inside of a function
that expects a numeric data type (T $\to$ 1, F $\to$ 0). So \texttt{sum(df\$delta\_fail)}>0
when any of the deltas have not converged, and is 0 when all of the deltas have
converged. So \texttt{sum(df\$delta\_fail)==0} is testing convergence of all 
the deltas. 

```{r convergence1}
library(latex2exp)
ggplot(result1000$MADdf, aes(x=i, y=sigma)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log2') +

  xlab('iterations') + ylab('Mean Absolute Difference in simga_10') +
  theme_linedraw()
```



\newpage
- **Now change the value of $\mu_{guess}$ to .001 and .01. How does this change the population shares?
Explain why this happens.**

\vspace{2em}
```{r mu changes, results='hide'}
result001 <- deltas(df = la_data_white,
                   delta_guess = delta_guess1,
                   mu_guess = .001,
                   counter_max = 1000)
result01 <- deltas(df = la_data_white,
                   delta_guess = delta_guess1,
                   mu_guess = .009,
                   counter_max = 1000)
```

I was running into a recursion depth limit when trying to use mu = 0.01 -- it
would stop after 704 iterations. This is not an issue with the R function, just
a limitation imposed by my linux operating system. I didn't want to spend the time
increasing the recursion limit, so I just decreased to 0.009 and it converged after
`r result01$iterations` iterations.


The population shares do not change -- these are defined before the function and
are not being estimated. The population share estimates at each iteration change
though -- they converge slower for larger values of \texttt{mu\_guess}. To visualize
convergence rates, I have plotted the sigma 2010 MAD below over the iterations.



```{r convergence2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
library(latex2exp)
MADdf = rbind(mutate(result1000$MADdf, mu=0.003, color='blue'),
