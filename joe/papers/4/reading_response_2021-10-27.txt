Paper: Do better schools matter? Parental valuation of elementary education

In my opinion, this paper was extremeley well written, perhaps aided significantly by the simplicity of the research design. I would accept this paper because: (1) it provides easy-to-understand solution to an obvious problem; and (2) the explanation of the problem and method used is very clear, making the contribution obvious.

However, the method of using housing prices, like most of the previous methods used before, has a serious limitation: it excludes renters. Choice of school quality is a more prominant issue for lower income families not only because choosing to pay $3000 for a better school is a much large portion of their income, but also because they have fewer resources to address problems with education while staying at the same school (like tutoring or mentoring programs). 

This isn't an easy problem to address but it was large concern I had with the area of research claiming to be estimating parental value of education while leaving out the most educationally-vulnerable group of parents and children.
