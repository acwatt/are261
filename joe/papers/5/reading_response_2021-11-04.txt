Paper: Wages, Rents, and the Quality of Life
Jennifer Roback
Yale University

It's simple and easy to read. The problem is a complex one, but Roback shows the major conflict with the current (in 1982) standard practices of Hedonic models with a relatively simple example -- wage rates and land payments. The math is easy to follow and the interpretations of terms make it a desirable paper to apply to your own research. The author also points out when estimation will have a clear result and when it is ambiguous.


This is getting published because it created a new quality of life score for cities that really shakes up the existing rankings -- this is something that people care about and can get passionate about in discussions (researchers, the general public, and politicians, alike).
